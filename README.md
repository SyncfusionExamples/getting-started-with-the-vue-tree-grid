## Features and Benefits

### Adaptive UI layout

The Vue Tree Grid user interface is customized and redesigned for great views and usability on small screens. Filter, search, and edit dialogs are adaptive to the screen size.

### Column 

Columns define the schema of a data source in Vue Tree Grid. Features include formatting, column definitions, text wrapping, column chooser, column menu, column reordering, and other important features.

### Paging

Through paging, a segment of data can be viewed from the assigned data source. The Vue Tree Grid offers built-in pager UI with options to customize its entire UI. It also has an on-demand paging mode for effective data retrieval from remote web services.

### Filtering

Filtering helps view specific or related records that meet a given filtering criteria. It supports various filter types that include powerful Excel-like filter. The Vue Tree Grid filter allows users to choose appropriate filter types, define their own custom filtering logic, and customize the filtering UI based on their application needs. Filtering with related parent or child records can be defined.
