# Getting Started with the Vue Tree Grid

The [Vue TreeGrid](https://www.syncfusion.com/vue-components/vue-tree-grid?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=vue-tree-grid-github-samples) is a feature-rich control used to visualize self-referential, hierarchical data effectively in a tabular format (a tree-like structure). A quick-start project that shows how to work with the Syncfusion Tree Grid in a Vue application. This project contains simple code customization, as well as some important features like binding data, customizing columns, and enable paging, sorting, and filtering.

## Project prerequisites

Make sure that you have the latest versions of Vue, Node, Vue Class Component, and Visual Studio Code in your machine before starting to work on this project.

### How to run this application?

To run this application, you need to clone the `getting-started-with-the-vue-tree-grid` repository and then open it in Visual Studio Code. Now, simply install all the necessary react packages into your current project using the `npm install` command and run your project using the `npm run serve` command.

## Features and Benefits

### Adaptive UI layout

The Vue Tree Grid user interface is customized and redesigned for great views and usability on small screens. Filter, search, and edit dialogs are adaptive to the screen size.

### Column 

Columns define the schema of a data source in Vue Tree Grid. Features include formatting, column definitions, text wrapping, column chooser, column menu, column reordering, and other important features.

### Paging

Through paging, a segment of data can be viewed from the assigned data source. The Vue Tree Grid offers built-in pager UI with options to customize its entire UI. It also has an on-demand paging mode for effective data retrieval from remote web services.

### Filtering

Filtering helps view specific or related records that meet a given filtering criteria. It supports various filter types that include powerful Excel-like filter. The Vue Tree Grid filter allows users to choose appropriate filter types, define their own custom filtering logic, and customize the filtering UI based on their application needs. Filtering with related parent or child records can be defined.
